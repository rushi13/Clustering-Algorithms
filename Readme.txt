Readme

The python scripts have been written using Python 2.7.12

In order to run the python scirpts, some python modules will have to be installed on the system from which they are being run. 

The modules can be installed using:
```
pip install <module name>
```

The list of all the modules required are:
numpy
pandas
sklearn
copy
csv
time
matplotlib
scipy
warnings
pylab

[NOTE: Some of these modules will be provided in Python by default, depending on the Python version]

The 4 clustering algorithms have been implemented in their own .py files in their own folders. Please navigate to the folders and run the following command.
```
python <filename>.py
```

The following are the filenames for each of the algorithms:
k-means: kmeans.py
k-medoids: launch.py
dbscan: dbscan.py
snn: snn.py

The results for each of these files will be printed on the console.

The datasets required for each of the clustering algorithms have been imported by using import statements for each algorithm.
